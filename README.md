# OpenGMP

This project is an open source gothic 2 - the night of the raven multiplayer implementation.
Currently it's more like a draft than a working multiplayer solution.

## Building the programs
The build system for the server project is implemented with a tool called cmake.
OpenGMP-Server can be built on windows and linux operating systems.

### Building the server on linux
To build the server on a linux system, the following tools have to be installed:
* git
* cmake
* build-essential

sudo apt install git cmake build-essential
